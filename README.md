# Social Network API

## Description

Social Network API is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The project utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database for data storage, and the Mongoose ODM for interacting with the database.

### Motivation
The motivation behind building this project was to create a backend solution for a social network application that allows users to interact with each other by sharing thoughts, reacting to posts, and managing their friend connections.

### Problem Solved
The Social Network API addresses the need for a backend infrastructure to support social networking features such as creating and managing user accounts, posting thoughts, reacting to posts, and managing friend connections.

### What I Learned
Through building this project, I gained experience in designing RESTful APIs, implementing CRUD operations for managing data, working with NoSQL databases (MongoDB), and using Mongoose ODM to simplify interactions with the database.
